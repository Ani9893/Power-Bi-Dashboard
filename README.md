🌟 *Power BI Dashboard Showcase: Transforming Data into Insights *🌟
I'm thrilled to share my recent Power BI project-a comprehensive dashboard for blinkit, designed to deliver actionable insights into outlet sales,
customer trends, and operational metrics. This dashboard represents my journey in transforming raw data into a powerful tool for decision-making.

🔑 Key Features of the Dashboard:
✅ Total Sales: $1.20M
✅ Average Sales per Transaction: $141
✅ Performance Insights: Outlets analyzed by location, size, and item type
✅ Customer Metrics: Average ratings and sales trends over time
✅ Interactive Filters: Customizable views for better decision-making
🚀 My Workflow: From Raw Data to Dashboard
1️⃣ Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats using Power Query and SQL queries.
Ensured consistency in outlet names and item categories to maintain accuracy.
2️⃣ Data Modeling:
Built a star schema in Power BI, defining fact and dimension tables.
Established relationships between tables for seamless filtering and aggregation.
3️⃣ Data Processing:
Imported data from MySQL using Power BI's "Get Data" feature.
Applied transformations to prepare the data for visualization.
4️⃣ DAX Calculations:
Created custom measures for metrics like Total Sales, Average Rating, and Item Visibility using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
Added dynamic visuals with conditional formatting to highlight trends.
Applied SQL techniques such as joins, group by, and case statements to structure the data for analysis.
🌟 Outcome:
This dashboard enables businesses to track performance, understand customer behavior, and make informed decisions. 
Its clean, interactive visuals empower users to drill down into key metrics and trends effortlessly.
